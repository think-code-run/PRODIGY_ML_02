# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

Welcome to the repository for my second internship task! This task focuses on applying the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to better understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

# Task Overview:

In this task, we aim to:

1.Explore and Preprocess the Data: Understand the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.

2.Implement K-means Clustering: Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchase patterns.

3.Evaluate the Clusters: Assess the quality and characteristics of the formed clusters using various metrics and visualizations.

4.Derive Insights: Interpret the clusters to gain actionable insights for the retail store.

# Dataset:

We use the Customer Segmentation dataset available on Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

# Key Features:

Data Exploration and Cleaning: In-depth analysis of the dataset to handle missing values and prepare data for clustering.

K-means Clustering: Implementation of the K-means algorithm to identify customer segments.

Cluster Evaluation: Use of metrics like silhouette score and visualizations to evaluate cluster quality.

Insights and Interpretation: Analysis of the clusters to understand customer behaviors and preferences.
